# Multi-doc News Headline Generation Model: NHNet

This repository contains TensorFlow 2.x implementation for NHNet [[1]](#1) as
well as instructions for producing the data we described in the paper.

## Introduction

NHNet is a multi-doc news headline generation model. It extends a standard
Transformer-based encoder-decoder model to multi-doc setting and relies on an
article-level attention layer to capture information common to most (if not all)
input news articles in a news cluster or story, and provide robustness against
potential outliers in the input due to clustering quality.

Our academic paper [[1]](#1) which describes NHNet in detail can be found here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09386.

## Dataset

**Raw Data:** One can [download](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/NewSHead)
our multi-doc headline dataset which
contains 369,940 news stories and 932,571 unique URLs. We split these stories
into train (359,940 stories), validation (5,000 stories) and test set (5,000
stories) by timestamp.

### Crawling

Unfortunately, we will not be able to release the pre-processed dataset that is
exactly used in the paper. Users need to crawl the URLs and the recommended
pre-processing is using an open-sourced library to download and parse the news
content including title and leading paragraphs. For ease of this process, we
provide a config of [news-please](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please) that
will crawl and extract news articles on a local machine.

First, install the `news-please` CLI (requires python 3.x)
```shell
$ pip3 install news-please
```

Next, run the crawler with our provided [config and URL list](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/NewSHead/releases)

```shell
# Sets to path of the downloaded data folder.
$ DATA_FOLDER=/path/to/downloaded_dataset

# Uses CLI interface to crawl. We assume news_please subfolder contains the
# decompressed config.cfg and sitelist.hjson.
$ news-please -c $DATA_FOLDER/news_please
```
By default, it will store crawled
articles under `/tmp/nhnet/`. To terminate the process press `CTRL+C`.

The crawling may take some days (48 hours in our test) and it depends on the
network environment and #threads set in the config. As the crawling tool won't
stop automatically, it is not straightforward to check the progress. We suggest
to terminate the job if there are no new articles crawled in a short time period
(e.g., 10 minutes) by running
```shell
$ find /tmp/nhnet -type f | wc -l
```
Please note that it is expected that some URLs are no longer available on the
web as time goes by.

### Data Processing

Given the crawled articles under `/tmp/nhnet/`, we would like to transform these
textual articles into a set of `TFRecord` files containing serialized
tensorflow.Example protocol buffers, with feature keys following the BERT
[[2]](#2) tradition but is extended for multiple text segments. We will later
use these processed TFRecords for training and evaluation.

To do this, please first download a [BERT pretrained checkpoint](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert#access-to-pretrained-checkpoints)
(`BERT-Base,Uncased` preferred for efficiency) and decompress the `tar.gz` file.
We need the vocabulary file and later use the checkpoint for NHNet
initialization.

Next, we can run the following data preprocess script which may take a few hours
 to read files and tokenize article content.


```shell
# Recall that we use DATA_FOLDER=/path/to/downloaded_dataset.
$ python3 raw_data_process.py \
    -crawled_articles=/tmp/nhnet \
    -vocab=/path/to/bert_checkpoint/vocab.txt \
    -do_lower_case=True \
    -len_title=15 \
    -len_passage=200 \
    -max_num_articles=5 \
    -data_folder=$DATA_FOLDER
```

This python script will export processed train/valid/eval files under
`$DATA_FOLDER/processed/`.

## Training

Please first install TensorFlow 2 and Tensorflow Model Garden following the
[requirments section](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official#requirements).

### CPU/GPU
```shell
$ python3 trainer.py \
    --mode=train_and_eval \
    --init_checkpoint=/path/to/bert_checkpoint/bert_model.ckpt \
    --params_override='init_from_bert2bert=false' \
    --train_file_pattern=$DATA_FOLDER/processed/train.tfrecord* \
    --model_dir=/path/to/output/model \
    --len_title=15 \
    --len_passage=200 \
    --num_nhnet_articles=5 \
    --model_type=nhnet \
    --train_batch_size=16 \
    --train_steps=10000 \
    --steps_per_loop=1 \
    --checkpoint_interval=100
```

### TPU
```shell
$ python3 trainer.py \
    --mode=train_and_eval \
    --init_checkpoint=/path/to/bert_checkpoint/bert_model.ckpt \
    --params_override='init_from_bert2bert=false' \
    --train_file_pattern=$DATA_FOLDER/processed/train.tfrecord* \
    --model_dir=/path/to/output/model \
    --len_title=15 \
    --len_passage=200 \
    --num_nhnet_articles=5 \
    --model_type=nhnet \
    --train_batch_size=1024 \
    --train_steps=10000 \
    --steps_per_loop=1000 \
    --checkpoint_interval=1000 \
    --distribution_strategy=tpu \
    --tpu=grpc://${TPU_IP_ADDRESS}:8470
```
In the paper, we train more than 10k steps with batch size set as 1024 with
TPU-v3-64.

Note that, `trainer.py` also supports `train` mode and continuous `eval` mode.
For large scale TPU training, we recommend the have a process running the
`train` mode and another process running the continuous `eval` mode which can
runs on GPUs.
This is the setting we commonly used for large-scale experiments, because `eval`
will be non-blocking to the expensive training load.

### Metrics
**Note: the metrics reported by `evaluation.py` are approximated on
word-piece level rather than the real string tokens. Some metrics like BLEU
scores can be off.**

We will release a colab to evaluate results on string-level soon.
